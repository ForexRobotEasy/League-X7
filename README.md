# League X7 Expert Advisor

This is the code for the League X7 Expert Advisor, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This Expert Advisor trades on the EURUSD symbol with a default timeframe of H1. It uses a moving average indicator to determine trade entry points and has a customizable stop loss.

## How it Works

The Expert Advisor uses the `Trade` library to handle trade operations and the `MA` library to calculate the moving average value. It initializes the necessary variables, sets the symbol and timeframe, and configures the trade settings in the `OnInit` function.

In the `OnTick` function, the Expert Advisor checks if the market is open. If it is, it calculates the current moving average value and compares it with the bid price. If the bid price is below the moving average, it opens a short position using the `trade.Open` function. It also checks for any errors during the trade opening process and prints the appropriate message.

The Expert Advisor provides additional custom functions to enable customization of the EA, adjust the stop loss, close all positions, check if the market is open, get the current moving average value, and get the current stop loss distance.
